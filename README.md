The torchsde model is brought from the google-research/torchsde and utilized in my experiments.

The first experiment recovers 3D Lorenz attractor process from a given prior data.
To simulate the Lorenz experiment, open the ../experiments/sde_MNIST.ipynb file on google colab and run.

The second experiment trains and tests the MNIST image dataset using torchsde.
To simulate the MNIST experiment, open the ../experiments/sde_MNIST.ipynb file on google colab and run.
