# Stochastic Adjoint Sensitivity Method

The torchsde model is brought from the google-research/torchsde and utilized in my experiments.

## Running the Experiments on Google Colab

The first experiment recovers 3D Lorenz attractor process from a given prior data with various different coefficients for visual purposes.
To simulate the Lorenz experiment, navigate to the experiments directory and upload the latent_sde_lorenz.ipynb file on google colab and run all.

The second experiment trains and tests the MNIST image dataset using torchsde.
To simulate the MNIST experiment, navigate to the experiments directory and upload the sde_MNIST.ipynb file on google colab and run all.
