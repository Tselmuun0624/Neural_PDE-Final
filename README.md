The torchsde model is brought from the google-research/torchsde and utilized in my experiments.

The first experiment recovers 3D Lorenz attractor process from a given prior data with various different coefficients for visual purposes.
To simulate the Lorenz experiment, navigate to the experiments directory and open the latent_sde_lorenz_i.ipynb file on google colab and run, where i=1,2.

The second experiment trains and tests the MNIST image dataset using torchsde.
To simulate the MNIST experiment, navigate to the experiments directory and open the sde_MNIST.ipynb file on google colab and run.
