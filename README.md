#The torchsde model is brought from the google-research/torchsde and utilized in my experiments.

The first experiment recovers 3D Lorenz attractor process from a given prior data with various different coefficients for visual purposes.
To simulate the Lorenz experiment, upload and open the latent_sde_lorenz.ipynb file the in experiments directory on google colab and run.

The second experiment trains and tests the MNIST image dataset using torchsde.
To simulate the MNIST experiment, upload and open the sde_MNIST.ipynb file in the experiments directory on google colab and run.
